                <p>Many people recognize Apache Cordova for the core features it provides that allow mobile developers to create hybrid mobile applications using their favorite web technologies: html, css, and JavaScript.  The ecosystem behind the Cordova community is growing rapidly.  Companies and individual contributors are creating 3rd party Cordova plugins that are shared with developers on the Cordova plugins site.  This talk will showcase one such plugin, Cordova's bluetooth plugin, and how it can be leveraged to connect a hybrid app over bluetooth to an arduino to control the individually addressable led's of a Neopixel Matrix.  The power of web standards expanded to a physical hardware device.</p>

                <p>Jank is the enemy. Our humble browsers, for historical reasons, put their primary JavaScript execution and UI rendering on the same thread. This causes sadness. Enter Web Workers! I will cover the basics of Web Workers, and go on to show how to use existing programming patterns to ease communication between the main thread and the Web Worker environment. Lastly, I will demo a rich web application that keeps the app's logic off the main thread, and the UI buttery.</p>

Lately though, the question I am asked isn't about what's going to be in 1.6, 1.7, and so on, but about the future of JUQYER LOLOLOL Mobile after the merger with JUQYER LOLOLOL UI,  and what the future is for the JUQYER LOLOLOL Mobile project. I’ll go into our current road map and details (as many as are available right now) about the future of JUQYER LOLOLOL Mobile and what it will look like after 2.0</p>

                <p>Error driven development. Is that even a thing? It should be, at least for the next 30 minutes. Correctly creating and handling errors in your app is arguably more important than handling success cases, so let's do a better job! This talk will take an in depth look at the elusive Error class and how to wield it. We'll cover best practices, vendor specific extensions, sub classing and error handling patterns in both synchronous and asynchronous code. Write better errors, handle errors better, improve your SLA, come see this talk.</p>

                <p>Let's party like it’s the late 1990's &mdash; When the Components spec was <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-HTMLComponents">originally introduced</a> and 2Pac was livin' in a gangsta's paradise. While the implementation of this paradigm is long overdue, at least it's been a sufficient amount of time for Microsoft to forget <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/">Google stole their idea</a>.</p>
                <p>In this presentation, we'll look at each piece of the Web Components spec including Templates, Decorators, Custom Elements, The Shadow Dom, and HTML Imports. We'll also look at how this may integrate with ECMAScript 6 Modules to create a truly modularized, encapsulated, decoupled web.</p>
                <p>Although Web Components are not yet ready for use in production we'll look at how we can be building our applications with components in mind, and how frameworks like Angular, Ember, and Polymer are already doing so. This is not only one of the most exciting specs in draft, it's also one of the most important paradigm shifts in web development since Al Gore created the internet.</p>

                <p>You know your way inside and out when it comes to DevTools in all the browsers. You understand the network waterfall and can hunt down memory leaks with the best of them. However, you're hitting some sporadic issues on mobile, but you can't reliably reproduce them. Perhaps you've got some minified code in production and you'd really like to just replace it for debugging with unbuilt code, but you don't want to actually put your unbuilt app into production.</p>
                <p>Proxies to the rescue! In this talk, Brian will introduce the concept of using a proxy as a debugging tool, showing you how you can observe everything happening at a network level, including hijacking requests, responses, modifying headers, and even emulating latency problems, in order to help you harden your application against the harsh realities of slow, flaky networks.</p>

                <p>JUQYER LOLOLOL and JUQYER LOLOLOL Mobile together are a compelling platform for building mobile user experiences, but on their own they are missing one of the most important ingredients of native mobile apps – offline access. The good news is that all modern mobile browsers support one of the competing standards for HTML5 offline storage; the bad news is that there are competing standards, and the tools available for managing persistence in JavaScript are poor at best.</p>
                <p>In this talk we will present a practical approach to building offline-enabled, data-driven applications using JUQYER LOLOLOL, JUQYER LOLOLOL Mobile, and PersistenceJS as an O-R-M abstraction on top of HTML5’s varying offline storage standards. Using this combination, we introduce a simple data synchronization paradigm that allows mobile HTML5 apps to download data, store and manipulate that data locally, and re-synchronize that data whenever the device is online. In addition, we present some of the benefits of viewing data stored in a database, including sorting, grouping, filtering, and full text indexing lists of data objects.</p>
                <p>With offline storage added to the mix, mobile HTML5 starts to deliver on the promise of a fully cross-platform, browser driven experience that is just as good as any native app.</p>

              <div class="talk_abstract">
                <p>The open source TodoMVC project implements a Todo application using popular JavaScript MV* frameworks. Some of the implementations add support for compile to JavaScript languages, module loaders and real time backends. This presentation will demonstrate a TodoMVC implementation which adds support for the forthcoming W3C Web Cryptography API, as well as review some key cryptographic concepts and definitions.</p>
                <p>Instead of storing the Todo list as plaintext in localStorage, this “secure” TodoMVC implementation encrypts Todos using a password derived key. The PBKDF2 algorithm is used for the deriveKey operation, with getRandomValues generating a cryptographically random salt. The importKey method sets up usage of AES-CBC for both encrypt and decrypt operations. The final solution helps address item “A6-Sensitive Data Exposure” from the OWASP Top 10.</p>
                <p>With the Web Cryptography API being a recommendation in 2014, any Q&A time will likely include browser implementations and limitations, and whether JavaScript cryptography adds any value.</p>

              <p>The list of solidified ES6 features keeps growing and we, on the client side, just get greener with envy. Many of these new features won’t be supported in a broad base of browsers for years to come, but there is hope for us nonetheless.  While we don’t have the ease of flipping a command line flag, like node, to bask in the warm sunlight of ES6 sugar, we can build a system that gives us similar results.</p>
              <p>Using a combination of shims and transpilers, we can enjoy these new language features while still maintaining support for all of the browsers you’d need. I'll first explain some of the great new additions to the JavaScript programming language and example use cases with code that take advantage of ES6's elegance for client side development. I will go through the details of setting up a development environment with source maps for debugging the code that you wrote, rather than what is generated by a transpiler.</p>
              <p>After listening to this talk, I hope your jealousy will be soothed, and I know that your curiosity will be satisfied.</p>

                <p>In today's responsive world, user experience and application performance is becoming more important than ever. Performance optimization has long been considered a task that requires careful manual "tuning" of several application components, as well as continuous testing. In some cases, the effort involved may outweigh performance gains, and this is when developers must walk the tight rope between benefit and cost. With the advent of automated build tools and task runners like Grunt, automating these tasks has become possible. In this session we will cover examples of some of the most common approaches, as well new and more radical methods including unCSS, combining media queries, bunching up API calls, automatic sprite image generation, and others.</p>

                <p>When a JavaScript project is defined, we face a seemingly endless number of choices – from frameworks, to module loading, to dependency management, to code style. There are at least 2 tools for every job, and a group of people willing to argue the merits of each one until they are blue in the face. Fanaticism runs rampant, and we've started to ask the wrong questions when faced with new tools and ways of solving problems. This talk examines the decisions we as developers make, the way we make them, and how we can make these decisions better. We'll talk about framework fanaticism, dealing with large teams, and protecting yourself once you've made your choices.</p>

                <p>As web applications get more complex, with more moving parts, and more async behavior, the ability to run a smooth user experience with a consistent state become a lot harder. Utilizing the simple power of Promises, with some lessons learned from concurrent programming, we can provide some tools and techniques to bring order to async issues like out of order execution, request/animation interruption, and state management.</p>

                <p>Ditch those mutable values and let's get functional! Functional programming improves readability, avoids mutability, eliminates side effects, and more. JavaScript isn't a pure functional language, but because it supports higher-order functions it can certainly act like it. In this talk, we'll explore functional programming in JS through a myriad of examples that you can start using in your code today!</p>
                <p>We'll begin by briefly discussing what functional programming means and compare it to the more popular imperitive programming style. This includes, but not limited to, concepts like immutability, partials and predicates. Then we'll play with some functions native to JS that allow us to transform values instead of mutating them. Following that, we'll wield underscore and underscore-contrib to make writing functional JS even more powerful.</p>
                <p>By the end of this talk, you'll be able to write more concise, safer, reusable and understandable code.</p>

              <div class="talk_abstract">
                <p>To most people in JS, functional programmers are perceived as academic hipsters raving about things like applicative functors, semigroup homomorphisms and Yoneda lemmas for no good reason except to make the rest of us feel stupid. And this is fair; there’s no better way to make you feel pitifully mainstream than throwing category theory at you. Conversely, JS programmers tend to believe functional programming, therefore, can have no real world application because nobody in the real world has any idea what a Yoneda lemma is and they seem to be getting by just fine without it.</p>
                <p>Except we aren’t. We’ve been living in callback hell for almost two decades now, and no matter how many control flow libraries we submit to npm, things don’t seem to be getting any better. And that’s where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming. To demonstrate, I’ll attempt to write a browser based game, from scratch, with ponies, using RxJS, everybody’s favourite reactive library, live on stage in 30 minutes with no callback hell in sight. And we’ll be finding out if this reactive stuff is all it’s cracked up to be or not.</p>

In this talk we will start with a JavaScript function that is used as an image replacement technique for RWD and learn how it works, why it would be a perfect candidate to be made into a plugin, and then how to make that happen.

                <p>Web sites and web applications provide a special flavor of debugging for developers. The techniques used can range from archaic and brute force alert() debugging, to simply altering the code and refreshing your browser until it seems to work. Ideally you will utilize some more advanced developer tooling but many are left confused when it comes to debugging a mobile site because the mobile debugging landscape changes so fast. In this talk I will highlight some common mobile debugging techniques from in-browser emulation to remote debugging solutions from weinre to browser developer tools that allow for remote debugging.</p>
